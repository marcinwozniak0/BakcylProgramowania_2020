## Dependencies
Only requirement is that APT package manager has been installed already on your devie.
To install project dependencies you have to simply run the following command in the root of this repo:
```bash
./build.bash
```
## Installation problems
If you have any problems with installing dependencies, try updating your package manager and install again.
If you have any problems with running `build.bash` script, change your privileges by running `chmod +x ./build.bash` and try again.
